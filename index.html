											<h2>A DOCUMENTARY FILM TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT HEALTH AND THE HUMAN BODY</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Life is electric. Our vital signs (heart rate, heart rhythm, and brain activity) are electrical signals that doctors
											use to diagnose medical problems. But the electric nature of life runs much deeper than this. For centuries, scientists
											have postulated the existence of an electric or electromagnetic field that governs all life. Researchers in more recent
											times have developed equipment capable of actually measuring this field. Changes in the electromagnetic field occur
											before, during, and after any change in health status. Treatments based on electromagnetic principles are also now
											being used to treat a wide range of medical conditions including: pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and cancer.
											Electricity has also been used to regrow limbs in animals and mend fractures in humans. In many cases the appropriate
											application of electromagnetic fields has been shown to be more effective than the medications that are currently
											used, and without the side effects. This is very important because prescribed medications are now a leading cause
											of death â€“ more than 106,000 people die each year in the United States alone due to the side effects of medications.
											The understanding of the Body Electric has the potential to revolutionize medicine. In the future, medical treatments
											will be based on the prescription of appropriate frequencies (electroceuticals) rather than pharmaceuticals.</p>
